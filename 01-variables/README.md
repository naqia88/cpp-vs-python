# Day 1: Variables & Data Types
This folder contains C++ and Python examples for Day 1 of the "C++ vs Python Fundamentals" series.
## Concept
Variables store data in memory. The key difference between C++ and Python is **typing**:
**C++:** static typing, type must be declared at compile time
**Python:** dynamic typing, type is determined at runtime

Understanding this difference is critical for memory management, performance, and writing safe code.
