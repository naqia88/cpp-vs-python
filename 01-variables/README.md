# Day 1: Variables & Data Types
This folder contains C++ and Python examples for Day 1 of the "C++ vs Python Fundamentals" series.
## Concept
Variables store data in memory. The key difference between C++ and Python is **typing**:
### C++ Variables

- **Static Typing:** Every variable must have a declared type (`int`, `double`, `string`) that cannot change.  
- **Declaration & Initialization:** Variables must be declared before use.  
- **Memory & Pointers:** Variables store values at specific memory addresses. C++ allows direct pointer manipulation (`&`) if needed.  

### Python Variables

- **Dynamic Typing:** Type is inferred at assignment and can change dynamically.

- **Assignment:** Variables are created at the moment of assignment.

- **Object References & Memory Management:** Variables are labels referring to objects in memory. Python handles memory automatically via garbage collection.
