# Text Analyzer C++ vs Python

This folder contains C++ and Python implementations of a simple Text Analyzer tool that demonstrates string manipulation, object-oriented programming, and logical processing in both languages.


## Concept

A Text Analyzer processes a sentence or paragraph and extracts useful information such as word count, vowel count, and character frequency.

This project integrates multiple foundational programming concepts into a practical and real-world relevant application, especially useful for data preprocessing and NLP basics.


## C++ Implementation

- Uses `std::string` for text storage  
- STL container `std::map` for character frequency  
- Encapsulation with `private` methods and attributes  
- Loop traversal using range-based `for`  
- Console input/output using `getline`, `cin`, and `cout`  
- Strong compile-time type safety and structure  


## Python Implementation

- Uses built-in `str` type for text handling  
- Dictionary for character frequency counting  
- Class structure with constructor `__init__`  
- Simple loop traversal and generator expressions  
- User input using `input()` and output using `print()`  
- High readability and rapid development speed  


## Learning Objective

Understand how the same logical problem can be solved in two programming languages while applying:

- Strings and Text Processing  
- Classes and Objects  
- Access Control Principles  
- Loops and Conditional Logic  
- Maps / Dictionaries  
- Method Scope and Encapsulation  

These skills form a strong base for data validation, preprocessing pipelines, and text-based applications.

- `python_example.py` — Text Analyzer implemented in Python  


## Key Operations Covered

- Calculating text length  
- Counting words  
- Counting vowels  
- Character frequency analysis  
- Class creation and method usage  
- Console input and output  

## Summary

Both C++ and Python effectively implement the same text-analysis logic while reflecting their design philosophies.

**C++** emphasizes control, performance, and strict encapsulation.  
**Python** emphasizes simplicity, speed of development, and expressive syntax.

Completing this project strengthens cross-language problem-solving ability and builds a strong foundation for text-based and data-driven programming tasks.
