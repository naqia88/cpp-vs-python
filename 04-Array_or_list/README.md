# Arrays (C++) vs Lists (Python)

This folder contains C++ and Python examples demonstrating how collections of data are stored and accessed in both languages.

## Concept
Arrays and lists are used to store multiple values under a single variable name.

Although they serve the same purpose, C++ arrays and Python lists differ significantly in design, flexibility, and memory handling.

### C++ Arrays
- Fixed size (size must be known at declaration)
- Store elements of the same data type
- Stored in contiguous memory locations
- Provide low-level control and efficiency

### Python Lists
- Dynamic size (can grow or shrink)
- Can store mixed data types
- Memory management is abstracted
- Provide flexibility and ease of use

## Learning Objective
Understand how data collections are implemented in C++ and Python, and how design choices impact performance, safety, and usability.
