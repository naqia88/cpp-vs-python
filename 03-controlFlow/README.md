# Day 3: Control Flow (Conditionals & Loops):

This folder contains C++ and Python examples for Day 3 of the **"C++ vs Python Fundamentals"** series.

## Concept:
Control flow determines **how and when different parts of a program execute**.  
It allows programs to make decisions and repeat actions based on conditions.
The core logic is the same in both languages, but the **design philosophy differs**.

### Conditional Statements:
- Used to execute code based on conditions.
- C++ relies on explicit syntax (`{}`).
- Python relies on indentation for structure.

### Loops:
- Used to repeat a block of code.
- C++ emphasizes explicit counters and control.
- Python emphasizes readability and iteration.

## Learning Objective:
Understand how **decision-making and repetition** are implemented in C++ and Python, and how language design impacts clarity, safety, and control.
