# Day 5: Functions
This folder contains C++ and Python examples demonstrating how reusable blocks of code are implemented, called functions in both languages.

## Concept

Functions allow you to group code into reusable units. They reduce redundancy, improve readability, and make programs modular.

### C++ Functions
- Defined with return type, name, and parameters
- Can be declared before `main()` and defined later
- Supports pass-by-value and pass-by-reference
- Can be overloaded (same name, different parameters)

### Python Functions / Methods
- Defined with `def` keyword
- Dynamic typing; return type not explicitly declared
- All arguments are pass-by-object-reference
- Methods are functions inside classes
