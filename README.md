# C++ vs Python Fundamentals  (30-Day Learning Series)

Welcome! This repository contains a **30-day series** comparing **C++ and Python fundamentals**.  
Each folder represents one day/topic, with code examples and explaination(README.md file).

## **Purpose**
The goal of this series is to:
Understand programming fundamentals by comparing C++ and Python side by side.
Highlight differences in typing, memory management, syntax, and structure.
Provide reference code for learners who want to explore both languages.

## **How to Use This Repo**

1. Open the folder for the day/topic you want to explore (e.g., `01-variables`)
2. Each folder contains:
`cpp_example.cpp`  C++ code example
`python_example.py`  Python code example
`README.md` explanation of the concept and trade-offs
3. You can run the code locally to see
