# Inheritance C++ vs Python

This folder contains C++ and Python examples demonstrating how Inheritance enables one class to reuse properties and behaviors of another class, improving code reusability, scalability, and clean architecture in Object-Oriented Programming.


## Concept

Inheritance is an OOP principle where a child (derived) class acquires attributes and methods from a parent (base) class.  
It reduces duplication, promotes hierarchical design, and allows extension of functionality without modifying existing code.


## C++ Inheritance

- Uses access specifiers: public, protected, private  
- Supports Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Multiple, and Hybrid inheritance  
- Strong compile-time enforcement and strict structure  
- Method overriding using virtual and override keywords  
- High performance and memory control  
- Suitable for system-level and large-scale applications  


## Python Inheritance

- Simple and minimal syntax using parentheses (ParentClass)  
- Supports multiple inheritance naturally  
- Dynamic typing and runtime polymorphism  
- Access control based on conventions (_protected, __private)  
- Faster development and high readability  
- Common in AI, scripting, and rapid prototyping

## Learning Objective

Understand how inheritance works in both C++ and Python, including base and derived classes, method overriding, and multiple inheritance.  
These skills are essential for building scalable, maintainable, and modular software systems.

- cpp_example.cpp — Demonstrates inheritance and multiple inheritance in C++  
- python_example.py — Demonstrates inheritance and multiple inheritance in Python  


## Key Concepts Covered

- Creating base and derived classes  
- Access specifiers / naming conventions  
- Method overriding  
- Multiple inheritance  
- Code reuse and hierarchy building  
- Basic polymorphism behavior  


## Summary

Both C++ and Python provide powerful inheritance mechanisms.  
C++ emphasizes strict control, performance, and compile-time safety, while Python focuses on flexibility, speed of development, and readability.  
Mastering inheritance in both languages strengthens core OOP fundamentals and prepares developers for real-world software architecture.
