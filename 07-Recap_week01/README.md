# Day 7: Week 1 Recap & Coding Challenge:
This folder contains C++ and Python examples demonstrating a **full recap of Week 1 concepts**, including syntax, variables, data types, operators, loops, conditionals, arrays/lists, functions, and advanced function features. Day 7 focuses on **reviewing all concepts learned so far** and applying them in a practical challenge: the **Student Marks Analyzer**.

## Concept

Week 1 covered the foundational building blocks of programming in both C++ and Python.

- **Syntax & Variables (Day 1):** Understanding how to declare variables, assign values, and perform input/output operations.  
- **Operators & Expressions (Day 2):** Using arithmetic, relational, and logical operators to perform calculations and comparisons.  
- **Conditionals & Loops (Day 3):** Controlling program flow with `if`, `else`, `elif` (Python) or `switch` (C++), and iterating with `for` and `while` loops.  
- **Arrays & Lists (Day 4):** Storing multiple data items using arrays in C++ and lists in Python.  
- **Functions (Day 5):** Writing reusable blocks of code for modularity; understanding function declaration, definition, and return values.  
- **Advanced Functions (Day 6):** Function overloading in C++, and in Python for flexible argument handling.  

On Day 7, all these concepts are combined in a **single coding challenge** that calculates the **average, highest, and lowest marks of students** using loops, conditionals, arrays/lists, and functions/methods. This consolidates the full Week 1 learning.

## Learning Objective

- Consolidate **all Week 1 concepts** in a single program  
- Practice **loops, conditionals, arrays/lists, functions, and I/O operations**  
- Understand the differences in implementation between C++ and Python  

## Coding Challenge: Student Marks Analyzer

**Requirements:**

1. Input **5 student names and marks** from the user.  
2. Store the data in an **array (C++) / list (Python)**.  
3. Compute the **average marks**.  
4. Identify the **highest and lowest scoring students**.  
5. Use **functions/methods** for calculations.  
6. Use **loops and conditionals**.
