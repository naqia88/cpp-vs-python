# Classes & Objects in C++ vs Classes & Objects in Python

This folder contains C++ and Python examples demonstrating how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) begins with defining classes and creating objects in both languages.

## Concept

A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.  
An object is an instance of a class that stores data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

Classes and objects are the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming and are used to build scalable, maintainable, and reusable software systems.

## C++ Classes & Objects

- Defined using the `class` keyword  
- Supports access specifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`  
- Attributes and methods declared inside the class  
- Object is created first, then values are assigned  
- Strong type checking and high performance  
- Suitable for system-level and performance-critical applications  


## Python Classes & Objects

- Defined using the `class` keyword with simpler syntax  
- Constructor method `__init__()` initializes attributes automatically  
- No strict access specifiers (uses naming conventions)  
- Cleaner and more concise structure  
- Dynamic typing and rapid development focus  
- Commonly used in AI, data science, and web applications  


## Learning Objective

Understand how to define a class, create objects, assign attributes, and call methods in both C++ and Python.  
These skills are essential before moving to advanced OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

- `python_example.py` — Demonstrates class creation and object usage in Python  


## Summary

Both C++ and Python implement the same Object-Oriented principles but differ in syntax and flexibility.  
C++ emphasizes control, structure, and performance, while Python emphasizes simplicity, readability, and faster development.  
Mastering classes and objects in both languages builds a strong foundation for real-world software and data-driven applications.
