# Recursive Functions C++ vs Python

This folder contains C++ and Python examples demonstrating how recursion works in both languages—solving problems by having functions call themselves.

## Concept
Recursion is a programming technique where a function solves a problem by breaking it into smaller, similar sub-problems, calling itself until a base case is reached.

Although C++ and Python both support recursion, they differ in syntax, performance considerations, and system limits. Recursion can simplify problems like factorials, Fibonacci series, tree traversal, and divide & conquer algorithms.

### C++ Recursive Functions:
- Function calls itself until a base case is met
- Uses stack memory for each call
- High performance and system-dependent recursion depth
- Useful for understanding low-level control and problem decomposition

### Python Recursive Functions:
- Function calls itself until a base case is met
- Clean and simple syntax
- Default recursion limit (~1000)
- Focused on readability and rapid prototyping

## Learning Objective
Understand how recursion is implemented in C++ and Python, learn the importance of base cases, and observe how problem decomposition differs between languages.
