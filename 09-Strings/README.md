Day 09: Strings C++ vs Strings Python

This folder contains C++ and Python examples demonstrating how text data is stored, accessed, and manipulated in both languages.


## Concept

Strings are sequences of characters used to represent text such as names, sentences, emails, and file paths.  
String manipulation is a core skill because most real-world data involves cleaning, formatting, and analyzing text.


## C++ Strings

- Stored using `string` from the `<string>` library  
- Mutable (characters can be modified directly)  
- Concatenation using `+` operator  
- Built-in functions like `.length()`, `.substr()`, `.find()`  
- Case conversion using `<algorithm>` functions  


## Python Strings

- Stored using built-in `str` type  
- Immutable (modifying creates a new string)  
- Powerful slicing syntax  
- Built-in methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`  
- Widely used for text processing and NLP tasks  


## Learning Objective

Understand how strings behave in C++ and Python and learn common manipulation operations such as concatenation, slicing, searching, and case conversion.  
These skills are essential for data preprocessing, validation, and user input handling.

- `cpp_example.cpp` — Demonstrates string operations in C++  
- `python_example.py` — Demonstrates string operations in Python  


## Summary

Both C++ and Python provide strong support for string manipulation.  
C++ offers more control and performance, while Python provides simplicity and powerful built-in methods for faster development.  
Mastering strings in both languages builds a solid foundation for text-based programming and data-driven applications.
